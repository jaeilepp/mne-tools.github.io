        "The channels are color coded by channel type. Generally MEG channels are\ncolored in different shades of blue, whereas EEG channels are black. The\nchannels are also sorted by channel type by default. If you want to use a\ncustom order for the channels, you can use ``order`` parameter of\n:func:`raw.plot`. The scrollbar on right side of the browser window also\ntells us that two of the channels are marked as ``bad``. Bad channels are\ncolor coded gray. By clicking the lines or channel names on the left, you can\nmark or unmark a bad channel interactively. You can use +/- keys to adjust\nthe scale (also = works for magnifying the data). Note that the initial\nscaling factors can be set with parameter ``scalings``. If you don't know the\nscaling factor for channels, you can automatically set them by passing\nscalings='auto'. With ``pageup/pagedown`` and ``home/end`` keys you can\nadjust the amount of data viewed at once. To see all the interactive\nfeatures, hit ``?`` or click ``help`` in the lower left corner of the\nbrowser window.\n\nWe read the events from a file and passed it as a parameter when calling the\nmethod. The events are plotted as vertical lines so you can see how they\nalign with the raw data.\n\nWe can check where the channels reside with ``plot_sensors``. Notice that\nthis method (along with many other MNE plotting functions) is callable using\nany MNE data container where the channel information is available.\n"
